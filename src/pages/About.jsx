            <div>Hi, my name is Vincent, and I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I have completed my first
                year at UofT and am going into my second year. I am passionate about game development, computer programming, mathematics and other related 
                fields. This website is a collection of all my past projects and skills.
            </div>
            <div>My main programming languages are Python and Java which I use for most of my projects. I have experience in other languages like R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React,
                however I would not consider them my main languages. I am currently working on improving my HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope to learn other languages in the future like 
                C++.
