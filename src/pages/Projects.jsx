                    <p>My first graphical game which is heavily inspired by Bloons Tower Defense 6. Use your towers to defeat creatures and protect your village. This game
                        has a medieval theme. The towers that can be used include attack mages, support mages, warriors, tack shooters, catapults, mortars, farms and ballistas.
                        There are 3 different gamemodes which are easy, normal and hard, and there are 4 different maps so far. All tower, enemies and sprites were drawn by me, 
                        albeit, some designs were inspired by Bloons Tower Defense 6. The game was made using Java for my grade 12 culminating project.

                    <p>A project which was made using Python. This project was made to used graphs and statisics to analyze different basketball players' careers. We took the top 75 NBA players in history
                        and then researched every award they won to allow users to have a clear idea of which player won which award. For example, you can filter the program to show players who won the MVP 
                        or filter to show players only in the 90's. We then used this program to determine a new statistic called award score which allows us to see the greatest players based on the awards 
                        thats they have won.

                    <p>This website! After learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, I decided to write this website to show some of my projects that I have created throughout my time studying computer science.
                        As I do more projects, whether for school or for myself, I plan to put them on this website.

                    <p>My very first game which was made using Java for my grade 12 culminating project. This game is a card game where you can play BlackJack or Three Card Poker, either singleplayer or multiplayer 
                        (on the same computer). The game is played in the Java console and has no graphics.
